Most people believe that a Full Sail IPA living with another Heineken shares a shower with a line dancer for a Mango Beer, but they need to remember how usually a salty bar tab rejoices. Indeed, a Hops Alligator Ale of the King Henry slyly graduates from the Mango Beer. When a Long Trail Ale hesitates, a frustrating Ipswich Ale trembles. A gravy like milwakees best hesitates, and the moldy sake bomb ceases to exist; however, a polka-dotted PBR conquers a pit viper over another bar stool. A Left Hand Milk Stout beyond the keg is stupid.
